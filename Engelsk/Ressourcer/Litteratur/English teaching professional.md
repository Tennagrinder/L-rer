# Correction techniques

It is possible to use a variety of techniques when it comes to error correction.

In one extreme we have just giving the student the correct answer. This ensures that the student catches all of their errors, but it does not allow them to be independent and able to catch their own errors. 

You could also mark mistakes in different ways.
examples: 

1. Mistakes underlines and each type of mistake coded with symbols or abbreviations
2. Codes for different kind of mistakes next to the line in which the error occurs
3. Just a cross or a mark next to the line where the mistake occurs (the student has to find the mistake)
4. Peer-correction. students underline mistakes in their classmates work and provide the correction.
5. self-correction without indication of mistakes. students hand in their work and get it back without comments (they then have to edit them alone)
6. writing feedback in sentences that indicated mistakes, were very supportive and responded to form and content

Methods number 4 and 5 should not be used without reason. The student may not be able to find the error. That is why they made the mistake in the first place. But given some guidance the student can find and learn from their mistakes, more than they might know.
