# Chapter 3 - Interlanguage

## Pages 31-32
Some researchers consider that the systematic development of learner language reflects a mental system of L2 knowledge (so a personal view of the system used by the L2). This system is often referred to as **Interlanguage**. The concept of interlanguage constitutes one of the first attempts to explain L2 acquisition by answering questions such as  "what is the nature of the linguistic representations of the L2 that learners form?" and "how do these representations change over time?" To understand what is meant by interlanguage we need to briefly consider **Behaviorist learning theory** and **Mentalist** views of language learning.

### Behavioristic learning theory
- The dominant psychological theory of the 1950s and 1960s 
- Language learning is like any other learning that involves habit formation. And habits are formed when learners respond to stimuli in the environment
### Mentalist theory of language learning
- During the 1960s and forward researchers started forming the "**Mentalist theory of language learning**"
- According to this theory:
	1. Only human beings are capable of learning language
	2. The human mind is equipped with faculty for learning language, referred to as **Language acquisition device**. This is separate from the faculties responsible for other kinds of cognitive activity (for example, logical reasoning).
	3. This faculty is the primary determinant of language acquisition.
	4. Input is needed, but only to "trigger" the operation of the language acquisition device
- The concept of interlanguage drew directly on these mentalist views of L1 acquisition

The shift could also be explained as the transition from "nurture" to "nature"

Where as we thought that only our upbringing and environment steered our language and language acquisition, we now understand that humans have an innate ability to acquire language, and we should strive to harness that.
