# Chapter six: Grammar

Students make different types of mistakes. The mistakes are different depending on their "level of education" and generally they make fewer of them the further along in the school system they are.

## Glossary
IL = interlanguage
L1 = Native language
L2 = Secondary language

Orthographic = the conventional spellings of a language - it comes from the Greek roots ortho, meaning correct, and graphos, meaning writing.

Syntactic = the rules of constructing writing eg. sentences etc.

Morphological =  In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), **morphology** ([_mor-FOL-ə-jee_]) is the study of [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word"), including the principles by which they are formed, and how they relate to one another within a [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"). Most approaches to morphology investigate the structure of words in terms of _[morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme "Morpheme")_, which are the smallest units in a language with some independent [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(linguistics) "Meaning (linguistics)"). Morphemes include [roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics) "Root (linguistics)") that can exist as words by themselves, but also categories such as [affixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix") that can only appear as part of a larger word. For example, in English the root _catch_ and the suffix _-ing_ are both morphemes; _catch_ may appear as its own word, or it may be combined with _-ing_ to form the new word _catching_.

Lexical = vocabulary, words, or morphemes of a language

i.e = "that is..." = latin - id est
e.g = "for example" = latin - exempli gratia

Her omtales 'sprog/language' som to distinkte former. systemet som lingvister undersøger og den fysiske "performance" som foregår hver gang en person taler eller skriver.

#### The main stages in error analysis are:
1. Error identification
	- Errors are only errors relative to a norm
	- In descriptive error analysis, it is advised to use norms which do not vary relative to the data in question. for instance by adopting norms used by the native speakers of the language
	- Error correction is best done by a team consisting of both native speakers and people with good knowledge of the L1
2. Classification of errors into linguistic categories
	- The aim is to specify in which areas of language errors occur.
	- For instance orthographic, syntactic, syntactic, morphological and lexical errors.
	- example from the text:
		- Lexical errors:
			- verbs: tells about, make... die
			- adjectives: new
			- adverbs: hardly
			- conjunctions: besides
		- Grammatical errors:
			- noun phrase: the society, a lot people
			- verb phrase: are getting, are trying
			- adverbial phrase: especial
			- word order: sometimes are the police trying, decision to take for some "leader"
		- Orthographical errors:
			- Spelling: aeroplans, inesent
			- word division: high jackers, high jacked, bomb attacks
		- Punctuation errors:
			- comma before restrictive relative clause: someof their friends, who are in prison
3. Classification of errors according to the causes of errors
	there are two major dimensions along which errors are usually explained.
	1. first, a distinction between learner-internal and learner-external causes. Errors may be the result of "internal" cognitive procedures like transfer from the learner's native language or generalization to new contexts of IL rules which the learner already knows. Alternatively, errors may be the result of factors external to the learner such as misleading teaching or teaching materials, or faulty instructions in a research context. In these cases, the errors are often labelled "induced" errors
	2. The second dimension for accounting for errors distinguishes between direct and indirect causes. This can be demonstrated by an example, namely the familiar overuse of the expanded tense in the IL of danish learners of English. The direct cause of the error is generalization, a learner-internal factor. The indirect cause might be learner-external factors such as infelicitous teaching, for instance in relation to sequencing (introducing the expanded tense before the simple tense), or to presentation and practice (the teacher using the expanded tense for a series of events).

#### Contrastive performance analysis
there are three ways in which contrastive performance analysis is used within interlanguage studies.
1. contrasting the performance of a group of native speakers of one language with the performance of a group of native speakers of a different language.
2. contrasting the performance of learners using their L1 with the performance of the same learners using their IL
3. contrasting the performance of learners using their IL with the performance of native speakers of the L2
