# Ch. 3 - Genres
The chapter outlines two major genres of writing and some of their sub-genres. with structures, alternatives and also a focus on different linguistic flair needed for different writing genres.

Most texts follow the same structure 

1. Introduction
2. Body
3. Conclusion

## Narrative
The telling of a story or the reporting of events.

A typical template for a full narrative could look like:
- Background
- Goal
- Problem
- The solution to the problem
- Evaluation

A narrative can deviate from this norm, but it is the most widely used, and dates back to old narratives and fairytales. Example:

### Different functions of a narrative
When writing a narrative, we might want to do different things like:
- Describing characters
- Report on events
- Dramatise important episodes
- Etc.
When writing these different elements, we use different linguistic properties. These different functions can also be called "sub-genres"

#### Reporting events
We usually report in chronological order (although flashbacks are often seen), and thus this function of reporting exhibits temporal linguistic properties. We typically see:

**Vocabulary**
	before, after, meanwhile, then, when, ...ago, the day after, once upon a time

**Grammatical properties**
	verb tenses (e.g. past tense and progressive tense, present perfect, past perfect).

#### Dramatising an episode
when telling a story, one often tries to make it more vivid by dramatising a situation in the narrative.

The structures often used to dramatise an event are dialogues and dramatic present

##### Dramatic present
The dramatic present is the reporting of a past event by the use of the present tense. 

An example from the text on coming to america.
Here in order to dramatise the living picture of the immigrants' coming to America, not only the present tense is used, but it is accompanied by very simple, active sentences.

##### Dialogue
In dialogues the reader gets a chance to experience the characters in action. Not only does this give him/her an opportunity to create his/her own views and opinions of the character, but it also lets him/her in on the spoken language.
the most important thing to remember about dialogues is that they have to be realistic.

The basic elements of dialogue are direct speech and reporting verb phrases.'

#### Point of view (functions of a narrative)
when narrating a story, one has to make up one's mind about perspective, i.e. from whose point of vire the story is being told. there are at least the following possibilities:

1st person narrative
3rd person narrative
	and different amounts of omniscience

#### Describing characters, places, things, etc.
Instead of simply describing the state of characters or other elements in your story, use more "painterly" descriptions.
This invites the reader to make up their own opinions and views of your characters, places etc.

So instead of:
"Mary is lonely"

Try:
"Mary sat in the big armchair watching the rain beat against the dark window. She had been sitting there now for days without speaking to anyone."

APPEAL TO THE READERS SENSES

## Expository-argumentative writing
A piece of writing in which the author expresses her/his view r reasoned opinion about a topic or expresses her/his solution to some kind of problem. its then the writers job to convince the reader that the solution is a valid one. 

A classical template for structuring a piece of expository-argumentative writing is:
* Introduction
* Explanation of the case under consideration
* Outline of the argument
* Proof
* Refutation
* Conclusion

As with the narrative genre, the expository-argumentative genre is very flexible. In fact even more flexible than the narrative, and the classical template outlined above is by no means the only possible one.

e.g. zig zag method of putting opposing views in front of the proofs

continuously contrasting the authors views with opposing views throughout the text.

It is also possible to omit differing views and opinions completely and solely focus on your own argument. (this is often viewed as less refined and less open-minded).

### Different functions - Expository-argumentative writing

this variety of possibilities for presenting one's argument (exemplifying contrasting, etc.) reflects different functions (or sub-genres) within this expository-argumentative genre. Each of these functions are represented by different linguistic structures. We will treat some of these functions below.

#### Exemplifying and explaining
illustrating with the help of examples.
e.g., for instance, for example, as we can see in, take..., to exemplyfi, we see this exemplified in, this is seen in, to mention but a few, to illustrate this

#### Comparing and contrasting
by comparison, like, as, similarly, similar to

#### Giving reasons
as a consequence, the reason being, depends on

#### Conceding
although, even though, true that..., though, albeit

#### Modifying

**Emphasising**
	in fact, indeed, certainly, clearly, of course

**Generalising**
	generally speaking, in general, overall, for the most part, usually

#### Listing
moreover, furthermore, first, second, third, first of all, then, next finally, also, in addition, besides.

#### Concluding
Then, in conclusion, as a result, thus, consequently, so therefore, hence

#### Summing up
in short, to sum up, all in all, summa summarum

# Ch. 6 - Writing a website

## How does the web site differ from the printed text?

The basic rules for writing are the same for printed as for digital writing. You need to start with your audience and make the reading process as easy and smooth as possible. The audience for the two different mediums, might differ slightly.

### Audience
The audience might have a shorter attention span and use faster reading methods like skimming. We also need to attract the attention immediately, or the user will navigate away. That also means that the site must be well structured.

#### Basic rules
- Your site needs to be catchy
- Your text needs to be brief
	- Cut out anything that is not essential
- Your site needs to be clear
	- Must be unambiguous and easy to understand. Simple and straight-forward us of the language.
- Your site needs a good structure
	- Navigation and correct placement of information needed to e.g. contact the business
- Your site needs an appropriate layout
	- That means having a purpose with the screen real estate and the context therein
