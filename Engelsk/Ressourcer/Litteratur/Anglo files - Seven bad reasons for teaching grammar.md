Seven bad reasons for teaching grammar

1. Because it is there
	- Much like climbing a mountain, just because it exists, You can also teach/learn grammar just because it exists. **Remember to prioritize depending on situation and goals of the learner **
2. It's tidy
	- We may teach grammar simply because it is more tangible and tidy. Learning grammar is a lot easier than learning a language. But grammar does not equal language
3. It's testable
	- Grammar can tend to be cheapest and easiest to test when learning a language. And since school "needs" a succes and failure state, we can gravitate towards teaching what is testable (mostly grammar) and testing what we have taught (mostly grammar)
4. Grammar as a security blanket
	- If you teach a bunch if grammar and the student learns a bunch of grammar, it may seem that they are learning a language. But it is merely an illusion
5. It informed my character
	- If i invested time and energy into learning grammar and put emphasis on that, you may feel that it is what matters the most, when in fact, it might not be.
6. You have to teach the whole system
	- You might think that you have to teach and learn the whole system, but that is false. some subsystems are detachable and independant. ask yourself: 1) how much of this do the students know already from their mother tongue? 2) how much of the rest is important? 3) how much of that have we got time for?
7. Power
	- If a student is better than you in any way, be that vocabulary or accent or some other aspect of english. Having superior grammar can be something that you fall back on as a tool to gain back power. This is not a good thing.

## 2 good reasons for teaching grammar
