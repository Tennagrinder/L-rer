# Chapter 3 - The direct method
As with the grammar-translation method, the direct method is not new. Its principles have been applied by language teachers for many years.

Most recently it was revived as a method when the goal of instruction became learning how to use a foreign language to communicate. Since the grammar-translation method was not very effective in preparing students to use the target [[General English Notes#IL L1 L2||Language/L2]] communicatively, the direct method became popular.

- The method has one very basic rule:
	- No translation allowed

The method receives its name from the fact that meaning is to conveyed *directly* in the target language through the use of demonstration and visual aids, with no recourse to the students native language.

## Example used in the chapter:
Students take turn reading from a text about reading a map and the teacher points to the parts of the map that the sentence describes. After they have read the text and seen the visual aids presented by the teacher they then get to ask questions about maps, but also words in general like: "what is a mountain range?" & "what does between mean?" and the teacher could for example draw the answer on a white/blackboard.

After all questions have been answered the teacher can then ask questions of their own eg. "class are we looking at a map of Italy?" and so on and so forth in a sort of Q&A session where the students are to answer in full sentences.

The example also uses dictation with blanks that the students have to fill out.

During the remaining two classes two classes of this week, the class will:
	1. Review the features of united states geography.
	2. Following the teachers directions, label blank maps with these geographical features. After this, the students will give directions to the teacher, who will complete a map on the blackboard
	3. Practice the pronunciation of 'river', paying particular attention to the /i/ in the first syllable (and contrasting it with /iy/) and to the pronunciation of /r/
	4. Write a paragraph about the major geographical features of the united states.
	5. Discuss the proverb 'time is money'. Students will talk about this is in order to understand that people in the united states value punctuality. They will compare this attitude with their own view of time.
