## Summary
This chapter speaks to balance between explicit and implicit teaching/learning. 

It poses questions that one could ask themselves about the Resources/examples and in general the way that you are conducting your classes.

## Excerpts
... However, "acquired" as opposed to "learned" knowledge or "implicit" versus "explicit" knowledge need not be viewed as dichotomies but as a continuum. [[Claus Færch]] (1986) illustrates types of cognitive representation of rule knowledge:

Classroom activities may focus on both implicit and explicit knowledge. Consciousness-raising activities make learners more explicitly aware of unanalysed language while their explicit knowledge of structures may be automatised through opportunities for use in communicative activities. [[Claus Færch]] illustrates the relationship between automatisation and consciousness-raising:

When the primary goal of an activity is accurate expression learners know that errors will be corrected.

## Teaching/learning grammar - some key questions and principles

### Some questions
Are forms presented in a textbook because they are needed for a communicative objective and not simply because all the grammar has to be 'covered'?

Do the illustrations reflect the natural use of language in communication rather than an artificial or unnatural use in contrived situations fabricated to highlight particular point of grammar?

Are both the formal and semantic aspects clearly highlighted so that learners can work out the relationship between meaning and form in particular contexts?

Do the examples properly illustrate the particular point (e.g. when tenses are introduced, is the aspect of tense stressed at the expense of the notional value?)

Is the grammar presented in manageable proportions, i.e. a little at a time in recurring and in new contexts (cyclic approach)?

Are differing learning styles and abilities allowed for?

Does the approach build on the learner's existing cognitive abilities and relate the unfamiliar to the familiar?

Is the type and amount of cognitive help related to the degree of difficulty of the particular grammar point (e.g. new concepts or different word order in L2 will require more explanation and practice)?

Are explanations or rules brief and simple, focusing on one point at a time?

Are there charts or reviews which clearly summarize the grammar work for learners

Are explanations or rules brief and simple, focusing on one point at a time

Are there charts or reviews which clearly summarize the grammar work for learners, focusing on both forms and functions/notions

Is there an appropriate balance between accuracy -oriented and fluency-oriented activities
