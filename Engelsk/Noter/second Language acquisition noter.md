## What kind of form-focused instruction works best?
A distinction is made between input-based and production-based instruction. 

**Production-based instruction** includes substitution drills, blank-filling exercises, dialogues, and games. 
Some SLA theories, like those of Stephen Krashen, argue that interlanguage is driven by input rather than output.

### Experimental Study by Bill VanPatten and Teresa Cadierno:
Two groups were compared: one with production-based instruction and another with input-based instruction focused on listening and responding to target structures. The input-based group performed better on comprehension tests and equally on production tests, suggesting that input processing is effective in form-focused instruction.

### Consciousness-Raising
This involves making learners aware of specific linguistic features through positive or negative evidence. Children primarily rely on positive evidence, which may not provide enough information for mastering their [[General English Notes#IL L1 L2||L1]], supporting the concept of [[General English Notes#Universal grammar||Universal Grammar (UG)]]. 

A study by Martha Trahey and Lydia White tested positive input on eleven-year-old French learners of [[General English Notes#IL L1 L2||L2]] English. While learners improved in using subject-adverb-verb-object (SAVO) sentences, they still made errors, indicating that positive evidence alone may not be sufficient for resetting grammatical parameters.

#### Positive and negative input/evidence
**Positive:**
- **Definition**: Positive evidence refers to the exposure learners receive to correct forms and structures in the target language. It includes examples of how language is used correctly, which helps learners understand what is acceptable in the language.
- **Example**: Hearing sentences like "She quickly ran to the store" provides learners with a model of correct sentence structure and usage.
**Negative**
- **Definition**: Negative evidence involves feedback that indicates what is incorrect or unacceptable in the target language. It helps learners recognize errors and understand the boundaries of grammatical structures.
- **Example**: If a learner says "She runned to the store," being told that "runned" is incorrect and that the correct form is "ran" serves as negative evidence.
